          <p>Wow, I said monthly updates&hellip; and here I am, updating 5/6 months later. I need to be better with this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to talk about how much life has happened&hellip;just going to start the updat.</p>
<h3><b>
Graphic Novel / Web Graphic Novel? In Production
</h3></b>
<p>In my last update, I said I was going to work on a new story. I&rsquo;m glad to say I am currently 35+ pages deep into it&rsquo;s development, and I&rsquo;m having a great time putting it together. I&rsquo;m growing as an artist and storyteller, and it&rsquo;s exciting to see my progress from page 1 to now.</p>
<p>So far, for the last 4 months, I&rsquo;ve been completing 10 pages a month (pretty slow, but I&rsquo;m okay with it). That&rsquo;s from storyboarding, to sketching, then inking, then finishing (with letters). It&rsquo;s been a pretty smooth process. There have also been tims I was worried I wouldn&rsquo;t hit the deadline of completing 10 in a month, but I&rsquo;ve managed to pull through. It&rsquo;s been a fun process.</p>
<h3><b>
Purpose: Getting Published? Having Fun?
</h3></b>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about what I want to get out of making comics. I&rsquo;ve grown to really enjoy the process of taking something from an idea to product. I&rsquo;ve also been thinking about what comes next. Do I want to be published? Do I want to do this for money?</p>
<p>There have been a lot of tweets on twitter about folks LEAVING the commercial side of comics to just work on stories they enjoy. This has been a huge turnoff for me in wanting to become published. Plus, I don&rsquo;t really need any money from these works.</p>
<p>This leaves me doing this for fun, which I&rsquo;m not too upset about. I do have fun working through it&hellip;and I&rsquo;m loving the storytelling aspect. Maybe keeping it as an expensive hobby (monetarily and time) is the way to go. It&rsquo;s bringing me joy&hellip;maybe that&rsquo;s all it needs to do.</p>
<h3><b>
Next Steps?
</h3></b>
<p>I really want to get into the habit of updating this monthly as I progress with this work. I need to hold myself accountable as I get better and make more works.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also realizing I need to start posting my completed works here somehow&hellip; This means I&rsquo;ll need to add some things to the site.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited for what&rsquo;s to come, and am ready to start making more works.</p>
<p>Until next time!</p>
